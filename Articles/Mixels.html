                My fascination with mixels
            </h1>
            <p>
                If you ever worked on pixel-art and engaged with the community or even just watched a simple beginners
                tutorial, you’ve probably heard of them. It's among the 1st things you’re told to avoid. One of the 1st
                rules you are taught when starting out. They make the art look messy, amateurish and simply bad.
            </p>
            <h2>
                But I'd like a definition
            </h2>
            <p>
                It's a bit of a big ask as there isn't really one. I've seen different people have slightly different
                definitions. It's kind of a vibe thing. I'll do my best to explain what they mean to me and most others
                here.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the most simple terms, mixels are pixels of different sizes combined together. It can happen within
                one image, sprite or due to different elements on video game screen clashing despite each sprite being
                consistent.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve also seen people use the term to refer to pixels that don’t comfort a proper pixel grid, or pixels
                that have different rotations. Though some others might disagree with that.
            </p>
            <p>
                You most commonly see them from people just starting off with pixel-art. Sometimes they’ll be using
                pixel brush on a big canvas or maybe combine weird scales of art in their game. Other times they might
                scale it improperly. There are many pitfalls that can lead to the dreaded mixels.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a quick example, here is how mixels looked on the packaging from mcdonald's during their
                collaboration with the minecraft movie.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/Mixels/Mixels-McDonalds.png"
                alt="Packaging for mushroom cheeseburger from mcdonald the minecraft movie collaboration" class="inset">
            <p>
                Or this example of using different size of pixels within one sprite without any care for how the final
                result might look.

            <h2>
                They are everywhere
            </h2>
            <p>
                This might be surprising given all that I just wrote here, but it is indeed true. They don’t appear
                often in art, but are ever so present throughout video-games. You might not have even realized, but they
                are all over the place in video games with pixelated graphics.
            </p>
            <p>
                They even appear in industry giants like minecraft or beloved indie titles such as terraria and stardew
                valley and many more games of all sizes and origins.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for art, throughout my time enjoying pixel-art I’ve seen only a few artists who utilized them on the
                regular. Which is quite a shame and also a reason I set out to write this little post of mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it’s easy for them to end up being an eyesore, there are plenty of use cases where mixels might
                look better and serve to improve your artwork. It’s all about knowing when to use them.
            </p>
            <h2>
                How I utilize them
            </h2>
            <p>
                The most common use case for mixels I have come across is for various visual effects within your art.
                Having various effects or particles, such as ones displaying emotions, be of lower resolution can help
                separate them from the rest of the image and enhance the pixelated feel. They can make the art feel more
                playful, more retro or give it a glitchy feel. Simply put, they are rather versatile.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s lead with an example. Let’s say I want to add heart symbols into this piece.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/Mixels/Base-Hearts.png" alt="Drawing of a running elf" class="inset">
            <p>
                I could just draw them the proper way to end up with image looking like this:
            </p>
            <img src="../img/Mixels/Pixel-Hearts.png"
                alt="Drawing of a running elf with 1:1 pixel hearts in the background" class="inset">
            <p>
                or I could draw a smaller sprite of a heart and scale it up for use within this drawing.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/Mixels/Mixel-Hearts.png" alt="Drawing of a running elf with mixel hearts in the background"
                class="inset">
            <p>
                This is all of course highly subjective, but the more pixelated style of the icons makes them more
                separated from the rest of the image. It, at least in my opinion it even gives it a bit of a
                video-game-y feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                And while it's not conclusive, I did few tests where people had to pick their favorite of the two. 14 of
                them ended up choosing the piece with mixels with only 1 choosing the other option.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Mixels are great actually
            </h2>
            <p>
                In this old piece of mine, I used them for the same reason, giving the image more pixelated feel.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/Girl_Mixels.png" alt="" class="inset">
            <p>
                And there exist images where mixels can be used to make them feel a lot more glitchy and distressing.
                They enhance the chaotic nature of such art in a unique fashion that is hard to replicate without them.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/Toxic_Love.png" alt="" class="inset ">
            <h2>
                Does this rambling have conclusion?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Somewhat. What I am trying to say is that even the most basic rules often have exceptions. While it's
                important to understand the rules and know to adhere to them, it's almost as important to understand
                when and how to break them to elevate your art. I hope this article was able to convince you that there
                are times to break even some of the most basic rules and that it doesn't automatically devaluate your
                art.
            </p>
            <p>
                And who knows, maybe you will too find the beauty of mixels and become as obsessed with them as I did.
